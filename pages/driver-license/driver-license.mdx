# Driver License

## Foreign Driver License recognition

If you have a foreign driver license (non-EU), it will be valid for 6 months
starting from the day of your arrival in Austria. After this period, you must
get your Austrian driver license. You must follow a
[validation process](https://www.oesterreich.gv.at/en/themen/persoenliche_dokumente_und_bestaetigungen/fuehrerschein/3/Seite.040500.html)
and take a driving test.

For doing that so, you must collect the following documents:

- Meldezettel (home address registration)
- Photo (Passport standard, which you can take in any metro station around
  Vienna)
- Original driver license
- Official translation of your driver license
  - Costs around 25€
- [ÖAMTC](https://www.oeamtc.at/) certification:
  - Take your driver license with the translation to any ÖAMTC around your
    district and ask for that
  - It costs around 18€
- Medical exam
  - Should take place in certified clinics for driver license tests. Be aware
    that if you have special necessities, you might have to do other medical
    exams.
  - Costs around 30€.

- Go to a driving school and fill out the Driver License form
  - You will get that at any driving school
  - You should pick one that is best for you, there is no recommendation
  - Prices may vary, but it will cost around 300€
  - You must take at least one driving lesson before taking the driving exam
  - The entire process is handled by the driving school

After following the steps above, you must take all the documents to the
[**Landespolizeidirektion Wien Verkehrsamt**](https://www.polizei.gv.at/wien/lpd/start.aspx)
and apply for the driver license validation. As of 02/Apr/2019, the address is
[Dietrichgasse 27, 1030, Vienna](https://goo.gl/maps/ryqzVsSp3NE2). It takes
around one to two months to get the response. As soon as it is done, they will
call you to notify about the results.  
From this moment on, you have to get in touch with your driving school to make
the arrangements for the driving lessons and the test.

**Reminder:** Your driver license must be valid at least 6 months before the
expiration date when applying for the validation process.
