## Directory structure

Some information is common and valid (mostly) for the whole country, but some
cities or regions have their own quirks. The common information is located in
the common directory. The cities/regions have their own directory.

If you are contributing to the project and the city's directory doesn't exist,
please create one and update the index here.
