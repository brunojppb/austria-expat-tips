# Work visa application and extension

You must book your appointment via the official
[MA 35 Online-Terminbuchung.](https://www.wien.gv.at/kontakte/ma35/terminvereinbarung-aussenstellen.html)
Each district has their own MA35 office, so make sure you book your appointment
at the right place, matching the district you currently live in.

## Rot-Weiß-Rot plus Karte (Red-White-Red plus Card)

To initiate the process of extending the RWR plus card you need to book an
online appointment first as mentioned in the previous section. It is recommended that you start this
process at least **2 months before** your current Visa expires.

  It is important to highlight that if your visa expires, you lose all your
  benefits and rights as a RWR card holder and must apply for a new visa from
  scratch once again. **Be mindful of your visa expiration date.**

To start the renewal process, you will need the following documents:

- KSV1870¹
- Application Form²
- Passport photo no older than 6 months
- Copies of:
  - Passport
  - Current Visa
  - Rent Contract
  - 3 latest rent payments
  - Work contract (if you are currently working)
  - 3 latest payment slips (yours, if you are currently employed)
- Meldezettel (if you moved since your last application)

If you have a partner, it i important to have the following copies of their documents:

- KSV1870
- Passport
- Visa
- Work contract
- 3 latest payment slips

After handing in the aforementioned documents to the MA35 official, they will
scan your fingerprints and hand you a processing fee which currently
(September, 2023) costs €140,00. It needs to be paid digitally.

Once your work-permit is ready, you will receive a letter from MA35 with the
scheduled date to go there and pick it up. Together with the letter, you will
also receive a final processing fee, costing €20,00. Make sure you pay it right
away and bring the proof of payment along with you once you stop by to pick up
your new Rot-Weiß-Rot Karte.

¹ The [KSV1870](https://www.ksv.at/en) is a report that confirms to the
authorities or your landlord that you will be financially reliable. It is valid
for 3 months and, as of July, 2024, costs around € 43,00.

² The application form can be downloaded while you are booking your appointment
online. As of July, 2024, [this page](https://www.bmi.gv.at/312/60a/start.aspx) had the form available for download.
Although [here is a valid copy](/files/rwr_plus_form_20231101_downloaded-july2024.pdf) of the most recent form in PDF.
Worth noting that would be wise to check if there are any new versions of the
form available while you are booking your appointment.
