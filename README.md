Are you an expat that just moved to Austria, or are you planning to move in soon? Here you can find valuable information about common things you must do and also the beloved bureaucratic processes the Austrians love so much 🙃.  

If you are a veteran expat, please contribute to this list. Let's help the expat community as much as we can.  

## Directory Structure

Some information is common and valid (mostly) for the whole country, but some cities or regions have their own quirks. The common information is located in the **common** directory. The cities/regions have their own directory.  

If you are contributing to the project and the city's directory doesn't exist, please create one and update the index here.
