# Work visa application and extension

## COVID 19 Schedule

Due to the pandemic, the office hours have changed a little and you cannot just walk in for an appointment. You must book your appointment online via the official [MA 35 Online-Terminbuchung here.](https://www.wien.gv.at/kontakte/ma35/terminvereinbarung-aussenstellen.html)

## Rot-Weiß-Rot plus Karte (Red-White-Red plus Card)
To initiate the process of extending the RWR plus card you need to book an online appointment first as mentioned in the [previous section.](#covid-19-schedule) It is recommended that you start this process at least __2 months before__ your current Visa expire.

> It's important to highlight that if your visa expires, you lose all your benefits and rights as a RWR card holder and must apply for a new visa from scratch once again. __Be mindful of your visa expiration date.__

To start the renewal process, you will need the following documents:

- KSV1870¹
- Application Form²
- Passport photo no older than 6 months
- Copies of:
  - Passport
  - Current Visa
  - Rent Contract
  - 3 latest rent payments
  - Work contract (if you are currently working)
  - 3 latest payment slips (yours, if you are currently employed)
- Meldezettel (if you moved since your last application)

> If your RWR card plus is based on your partner's Visa, and this person is responsible for your living costs (💸), it is also important to have the following copies of their documents:
>
> - KSV1870
> - Passport
> - Visa
> - Work contract
> - 3 latest payment slips

Once you hand it in all the aforementioned documents to the MA35 official, they will scan your fingerprints and hand you a payment bill for the new card that currently (October, 2019) costs €160,00.

¹ The [KSV1870](https://www.ksv.at/en) is a report that confirms to the authorities or your landlord that you’ll be financially reliable. It is valid for 3 months and currently (January, 2022)costs around € 35,90.

² The application form can be downloaded while you are booking your appointment online. Although, as of January, 2022, [here is a copy of the most recent form in PDF](../attachments/resident-permit-form.pdf). Worth noting that would be wise to check if there is any new version of the form available while you are booking your appointment.
