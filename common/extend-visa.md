# Work visa application and extension

You must book your appointment via the official [MA 35 Online-Terminbuchung here.](https://www.wien.gv.at/kontakte/ma35/terminvereinbarung-aussenstellen.html) Each district have their own MA35 office, so make sure you book your appointment at the right place, matching the district you currently live.

## Rot-Weiß-Rot plus Karte (Red-White-Red plus Card)
To initiate the process of extending the RWR plus card you need to book an online appointment first as mentioned in the [previous section.](#covid-19-schedule) It is recommended that you start this process at least __2 months before__ your current Visa expire.

> It's important to highlight that if your visa expires, you lose all your benefits and rights as a RWR card holder and must apply for a new visa from scratch once again. __Be mindful of your visa expiration date.__

To start the renewal process, you will need the following documents:

- KSV1870¹
- Application Form²
- Passport photo no older than 6 months
- Copies of:
  - Passport
  - Current Visa
  - Rent Contract
  - 3 latest rent payments
  - Work contract (if you are currently working)
  - 3 latest payment slips (yours, if you are currently employed)
- Meldezettel (if you moved since your last application)

If you have a partner, it's important to have the following copies of their documents:

- KSV1870
- Passport
- Visa
- Work contract
- 3 latest payment slips

After handing in the aforementioned documents to the MA35 official, they will scan your fingerprints and hand you a processing fee which currently (September, 2023) costs €140,00. It needs to be paid digitally.

Once your work-permit is ready, you will receive a letter from MA35 with the scheduled date to go there and pick it up. Together with the letter, you will also receive a final processing fee, costing €20,00. Make sure you pay it right away and bring the proof of payment along with you once you stop by to pick up your new Rot-Weiß-Rot Karte.

¹ The [KSV1870](https://www.ksv.at/en) is a report that confirms to the authorities or your landlord that you’ll be financially reliable. It is valid for 3 months and currently (January, 2022)costs around € 35,90.

² The application form can be downloaded while you are booking your appointment online. Although, as of September, 2023, [here is a valid copy of the most recent form in PDF](../attachments/resident-permit-form.pdf). Worth noting that would be wise to check if there are any new versions of the form available while you are booking your appointment.
