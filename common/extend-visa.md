# What do I need to extend my Visa?

## Rot-Weiß-Rot Karte (Red-White-Red Card)
**TBD**

## Rot-Weiß-Rot plus Karte (Red-White-Red plus Card)
To initiate the process of extending the RWR plus card you need to proceed to the [MA 35](https://www.wien.gv.at/kontakte/ma35/) office that covers the district you are currently living in. It is recommended that you start this process at least 3 months before your current Visa expiration date.

You will need to present the following documentation, to assure that you are in order with their imigration laws:

- KSV1870¹
- Application Form²
- Passport photo no older than 6 months
- Copies of: 
	Passport
	Current Visa
	Rent Contract
	Last rent payment
	Work contract (if you are currently working)
    3 latest payment slips (yours, if you are currenly working)
- Meldezettel (if you moved since your last application)

 If your RWR card plus is based on your partner's Visa, and this person is the money provider, it is important to also have the copies of his/her documents:
 - KSV1870
 - Passport
 - Visa
 - Work contract
 - 3 latest payment slips

After you present the documentation to the MA35 representant, they will scan your finger digitals and hand you a payment bill for the new card that currently (10/2019) costs 160,00 €.

¹If everything goes well, it takes around 30 to 40 days for the new RWR plus card to be ready. You need to come back to the same office with the paid bill receipt and some valid Id documentation (Passport or current Visa).

²The [KSV1870](https://www.ksv.at/en) is a report that confirms to the authorities or your landlord that you’ll be financially reliable. It is valid for 3 months and currently costs about 30,00 €.

The Application Form is not currently available on the Internet, you will most probably find it in the MA 35 office.
