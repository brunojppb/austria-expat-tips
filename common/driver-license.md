# Driver License

## Foreign Driver License recognition

If you have a foreign driver license (non-EU), it is valid for 6 months starting from the day of your arrival in Austria. After this period, you must get your Austrian driver license.
You must follow a [validation process](https://www.help.gv.at/Portal.Node/hlpd/public/content/139/Seite.1390000.html#Conversion) and take a driving test.  

For doing that so, you must collect the following documents:

- Meldezettel (home address registration)
- Photo (Passport standard which you can take in any metro station around Vienna)
- Original driver license
- Official translation of your driver license. Costs around 25€.
- [ÖAMTC](https://www.oeamtc.at/) certification: Take your driver license with the translation to any ÖAMTC around your district and ask for that. It costs around 18€.
- Medical exam. Should take place in certified clinics for driver license tests. Be aware that if you have special necessities, you might have to do other medial exams. I took mine here: [Landstrasser Hauptstrasse 33, Vienna](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Landstra%C3%9Fer+Hauptstra%C3%9Fe+33,+1030+Wien/@48.2038279,16.3873208,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x476d07720d400b47:0xbd948d50908b2307!8m2!3d48.2038279!4d16.3895095). Phone: +4306643160317. Costs around 30€.
- Go to a driving school and fill out the Driver License form. You will get that at any driving school. You should pick one that is best for you, there is no recommendation. Prices may vary, but it will cost around 300€. You must take at least 1 driving lesson before taking the driving exam. The entire process is handled by the driving school.

After following the steps above, you must take all the documents to the [**Landespolizeidirektion Wien Verkehrsamt**](https://www.polizei.gv.at/wien/lpd/start.aspx) and apply for the driver license validation. at the time of this writing, the address is [Dietrichgasse 27, 1030, Vienna.](https://goo.gl/maps/ryqzVsSp3NE2)
It takes around 1 to 2 months to get the response. As soon as it is done, they will call you to notify about the results.  
From this momment on, you have to get in touch with your driving school to make the arrangements for the driving lessons and the test.

**Reminder:** Your driver license must be valid at least 6 months before the expiration date when applying for the validation process.
